# Keys are generated using [age](github.com/FiloSottile/age).
#
# Administrators are expected to have a secret key available here. To add a new administrator, an
# existing administrator must re-encrypt all secrets using `sops updatekeys <file>`.
#
# The keys for the different hosts are derived from the host SSH keys using
# `ssh-keyscan <host> | ssh-to-age`.
#
# Technically there is no reason for the host specific secrets to also be encrypted for the
# administrators. The only reason they are is for convenience: since my trustmodel considers all
# administrators trustworthy the tradeoff between security and convenience is worth it.
